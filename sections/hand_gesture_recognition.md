# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition – Human-Computer Interaction

## 📌 Problem Statement
Build a model to recognize human hand gestures in real time using computer vision and machine learning.

## 🧠 Models Used
- CNN-based image classification for static gestures
- OpenCV + Mediapipe for real-time video processing

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
OpenCV, Python, Mediapipe, TensorFlow/Keras, Numpy

## 📈 Outcome
Achieved accurate classification of predefined hand gestures (e.g., thumbs up, peace sign) with webcam feed.
